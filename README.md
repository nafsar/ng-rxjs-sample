The RxJS library has many functions and methods.  It takes time to use all the operations and functions. However, it is possible to learn the concepts quickly for what you need for your projects.

Observer has three methods: next, error and complete. Observer can be passed to observable.subscribe (observer) method. ‘Observer’ subscribes to an Observable and then that observer handles the item or the sequence of items that Observable emits. The Observable class has several functions for generating observables from different type of streams like events, arrays, promises and any other data types and more.
